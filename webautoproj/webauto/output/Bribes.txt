Bribes - Kinza Finance ðŸ’° Bribes Additional Incentives Bribes, in the form of KZA, are an additive tool for incentivizing liquidity by fueling votes. Bribers can deposit bribes to make a pool more attractive to voters. Bribes deposited towards a pool will be distributed to all voters of that pool at the end of the current epoch, together with interest accrued. Bribes in the form of tokens for each lending market will be allowed in the future. I.e., a briber aiming to incentivize voters to direct emissions to the WETH pool can deposit WETH for the bribe.
