Header:
ABOARD-API-KEY: e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx 
ABOARD-TIMESTAMP:1637115675000 
ABOARD-SIGNATURE:4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o= The signature may be different if the request text is different, therefore the request should be normalized before signing. The following signature steps will take the order query on the above side as an example. Signature Method: 1. The request Method (GET or POST, WebSocket use GET), append line break "\n" Copy GET\n 2. The host with lower case, append line break "\n" Copy api.aboard.exchange\n 3. The path(WebSocket is fixed to /users/self/verify), append line break "\n". (Take the path from /api, such as /bsc/api/v1/order/orders, which is actually /api/v1/order/orders) Copy /api/v1/order/orders\n 4. Timestamp, append line break "\n" Copy 1637115675000\n 5. API Access Key, append line break "\n" if parameters are not empty. Notice, "data" in Post method is not parameter. Copy e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx\n 6. The parameters are URL encoded, and ordered based on ASCII(Use UTF-8 encoding and URL encoded, the hex must be upper case. For example, The semicolon ':' should be encoded as '%3A', The space should be encoded as '%20'). For example below is the original parameters: Copy orderId=1234567890
clientId=7623910
beginTime=1634437275876 Then above parameter should be ordered like below: Copy beginTime=1634437275876
clientId=7623910
orderId=1234567890 Use char "&" to concatenate all parameters. Copy beginTime=1634437275876&clientId=7623910&orderId=1234567890 7. Assemble the pre-signed text: Copy GET\napi.aboard.exchange\n/api/v1/order/orders\n1637115675000\ne2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx\nbeginTime=1634437275876&clientId=7623910&orderId=1234567890 8. Calculate the signature and pass the following two parameters into the encrypted hash function(HmacSHA256): pre-signed text Copy GET\napi.aboard.exchange\n/api/v1/order/orders\n1637115675000\ne2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx\nbeginTime=1634437275876&clientId=7623910&orderId=1234567890 your Secret Key Copy b0xxxxxx-c6xxxxxx-94xxxxxx-dxxxx Encode the hash code with base-64 to generate the signature Copy 4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o= 9. Put the signature into request header 'ABOARD-SIGNATURE'. PreviousWebSocket Private Information Streams NextGitHub Last updated 1 year ago On this page For example: Signature Method:
