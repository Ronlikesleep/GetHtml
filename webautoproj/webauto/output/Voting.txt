Voting - Kinza Finance ðŸ”® Voting Directing Emissions Voting on the Kinza Finance platform programs the direction of KZA emissions for upcoming Epochs. To vote, users stake KZA in exchange 1:1 for xKZA. Only xKZA holders are permitted to vote, preventing large-scale external influence and manipulation. xKZA in the redeeming process can also be used to vote, but at 50% weight. To encourage increased volume and further incentivize liquidity, Kinza Finance allows bribes to further encourage borrowers in specific lending markets. Voters can earn Bribe + Interest accrued to the asset they voted for. Previous xKZA Next - Tokenomics Bribes Last modified 9mo ago
